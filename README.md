The goal of this project was to build a React app that searches using the Spotify API to create a 'playlist' that would display for the user. The user would then be able to copy said playlist and add it to their actual Spotify library. However, I abandoned this project after discovering that the project documentation that I was following was broken. I was able to implemenent 5-6 different React elements and have them interact successfully but it is nothing to write home about.
